# Snake
A Snake-like clone created using SFML.

## Todo

There are a number of things that could be done to improve this project.

### Base functionality

[comment]: # (* Move multiple times if more time has passed)
* The snake grows when eating fruit
* The snake collides with itself

### Extra features

* Score visible during play
* The player ca restart the game after getting game over.

### Refactoring

* Move most of the content in Main.cpp to a Game class to more clearly show the flow of the game loop
* Improve the encapsulation of data (mainly decrease direct accessing of variables in Player and Fruit outside those classes)
* Improve snake movement to be less fixed to a certain update rate
